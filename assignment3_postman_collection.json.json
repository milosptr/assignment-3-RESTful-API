		"description": "# Postman Collection Overview\n\n## Description\n\nThis Postman collection provides a comprehensive set of API endpoints for a backend application designed to manage books and genres. The collection covers various CRUD operations for both books and genres, adhering to REST principles and best practices.\n\nThe collection includes requests for:\n\n- Reading all books and genres\n    \n- Reading individual books and genres\n    \n- Creating new books and genres\n    \n- Updating existing books\n    \n- Deleting books and genres\n    \n\nEach request in the collection is meticulously documented, providing details on the request URL, HTTP method, request body (if applicable), and expected response. Additionally, examples of successful and error responses are included to aid in understanding the API behavior.\n\nThe purpose of this collection is to facilitate testing and development of the backend application. It can be utilized to verify the functionality and correctness of the API endpoints, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend application.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Import the Postman collection into your Postman application.\n    \n2. Review the documentation for each request to understand its purpose and usage.\n    \n3. Configure the request parameters and payloads as necessary for your testing scenario.\n    \n4. Execute the requests and examine the responses to validate the behavior of the backend API.\n    \n5. Utilize the collection to perform thorough testing of the API endpoints and ensure compliance with the specified requirements and best practices.\n    \n\nBy using this Postman collection, developers can streamline the process of testing and debugging their backend implementation, ultimately contributing to the successful deployment of a robust and reliable application.",
